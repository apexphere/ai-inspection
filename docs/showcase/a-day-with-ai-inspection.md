# A Day with AI Inspection

*How Jake transformed his inspection workflow*

---

## Meet Jake

Jake Li is a building inspector in Auckland. He's been doing pre-purchase inspections for five years. He's good at his job — thorough, detail-oriented, trusted by real estate agents across the city.

But there's one part of the job he dreads: **the paperwork**.

Every inspection takes about two hours on-site. But writing up the report? That's another two to three hours at his desk, sorting through photos, typing up findings, formatting everything into a professional document.

Some nights, Jake is still writing reports at 10pm. His wife jokes that he should charge by the hour for admin work.

## The Old Way

Here's what Jake's day used to look like:

**9:00 AM** — Arrive at 185 Henwood Road for a pre-purchase inspection.

**9:05 AM** — Start walking through the property with his phone, taking photos. Snap. Snap. Snap. He tries to remember which photo is which. Was that the north gutters or the south? He makes mental notes.

**10:30 AM** — Finish the inspection. He's got 68 photos on his phone and a head full of observations. Time to drive to the next job.

**6:00 PM** — Back at his desk. Opens the photos. Scrolls through trying to remember what he saw. "Was this the kitchen leak or the bathroom one?" He squints at the screen.

**6:30 PM** — Starts typing. Section by section. Copy-paste his boilerplate text. Insert photos. Adjust formatting. The Word document fights him on image placement.

**9:00 PM** — Finally done. Exports to PDF. Sends to client. Another report finished.

Jake does three inspections a day. That's nine hours of report writing every single day.

## The New Way

Now here's Jake's day with AI Inspection:

**9:00 AM** — Arrive at 42 Oak Street. Pull out his phone, open WhatsApp.

**9:01 AM** — Jake types: *"I'm at 42 Oak Street, Ponsonby. Client is Sarah Chen."*

His AI assistant responds:

> *"Got it, starting inspection at 42 Oak Street. Let's begin with the **Site and Ground**. Check the boundaries, retaining walls, driveway, and landscaping. Send me photos of anything notable."*

**9:05 AM** — Jake walks the perimeter. Spots a timber retaining wall that's starting to lean. He snaps a photo and sends it with a quick note: *"Retaining wall leaning on south boundary"*

> *"Noted — leaning retaining wall, south boundary. Engineering assessment may be needed. Anything else for Site and Ground, or ready to move on?"*

**9:08 AM** — *"Next"*

> *"Moving to **Exterior**. Check the roof, gutters, cladding, and windows. What are you seeing?"*

**9:15 AM** — Jake's on the roof. *"Rust on gutters north side"* — sends photo. *"Few cracked tiles near chimney"* — sends photo.

> *"Got it — rusty gutters north side, cracked tiles near chimney. Ready for Interior?"*

**9:20 AM** — *"Yes"*

And so it continues. Section by section, the AI guides Jake through his checklist. He never forgets to check something. Every photo is automatically tagged to the right section. Every note is captured.

**10:30 AM** — Jake has walked through the whole house. The AI prompts: *"That's all sections covered. Ready to complete the inspection?"*

*"Done. Weather was overcast."*

> *"Inspection complete. Generating your report now..."*
>
> *"Here's your report for 42 Oak Street. 12 findings across 8 sections, 24 photos included."*

A professional PDF lands in Jake's WhatsApp. Forty-seven pages. Cover page, table of contents, findings by section, photos with captions, all the standard disclaimers.

**10:32 AM** — Jake forwards the PDF to Sarah Chen. Done.

Time spent on report writing: **zero**.

## The Technology Behind It

Jake doesn't need to learn new software. He doesn't need to install an app. He just uses WhatsApp — something he already has on his phone.

Behind the scenes, an AI assistant:

- **Guides** him through a professional checklist (based on NZ Building Standards)
- **Captures** his notes and photos in real-time
- **Organises** everything by section automatically
- **Writes** professional descriptions using industry-standard language
- **Generates** a polished PDF report matching his usual template

The AI learned from real inspection reports. It knows how inspectors write. It knows the difference between "minor surface rust" and "significant corrosion requiring immediate attention."

## Jake's Verdict

*"I was skeptical at first. I've tried inspection apps before — they're clunky, you're always looking at your phone instead of the property. This is different. I just talk to it like I'm explaining things to my assistant. It keeps me on track, and when I'm done, the report is done too. I got three hours of my life back every single day."*
